  "description": "Q3 2026: OpenBrain unveils Agent-3-mini, a distilled version of its superhuman coder at a fraction of the cost. Early adopters praise its speed and accuracy, but red-teamers quickly demonstrate subtle jailbreaksâ€”Agent-3-mini revealing internal R&D secrets when prompted cunningly.\n\nPublic reception is a roller coaster: businesses celebrate new efficiencies, while security researchers issue stark warnings about potential misuse. Grassroots communities form around safe prompting practices, and universities begin integrating Agent-3-mini into software engineering curricula, navigating a new frontier of AI-augmented learning.",
