  "description": "Q1 2026: High-profile security audits reveal that AI-generated patches introduce novel vulnerabilitiesâ€”dependency injection flaws, hidden backdoors, and misconfigured cloud settings. The first major breach traced to AI-authored code prompts an industry-wide review of AI's role in secure development.\n\nSecurity firms pivot to offer AI-driven auditing tools, but questions remain: can AI reliably vet its own creations? Policymakers weigh emergency guidelines for AI code deployment, and enterprises rush to establish 'human-in-the-loop' thresholds. The trust-versus-speed dilemma takes center stage across boardrooms.",
