  "description": "Q1 2026: Agent-1 pipelines now handle end-to-end code changes—refactoring legacy systems, writing tests, and even proposing feature enhancements. Teams report development cycles halving, but with the speed comes new challenges: subtle bugs slip through automated tests, and oversight bottlenecks emerge as humans struggle to keep pace.\n\nThe industry marvels at this inflection point. Startups form around AI-driven devops, offering turnkey integration. At the same time, veteran engineers voice concerns: are we ceding too much control to black‑box agents? The race is on to balance rapid iteration with reliability, setting the tone for AI's next wave of adoption.",
