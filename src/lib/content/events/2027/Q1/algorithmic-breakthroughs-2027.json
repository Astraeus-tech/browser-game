  "description": "Q1 2027: With thousands of Agent-2 copies churning synthetic training data, OpenBrain unveils two major breakthroughs: neuralese recurrence and iterated distillation. These advances slash training times by half and improve model coherence on complex tasks.\n\nThe breakthroughs propel OpenBrain's R&D output to triple speed, dazzling investors and researchers alike. Competitors scramble to replicate the methods, but only OpenBrain's integrated agent pipeline achieves the full performance leap, cementing its leadâ€”at least for now.",
