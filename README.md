## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup with Drizzle ORM

### Why Drizzle ORM?

This project uses **Drizzle ORM** for several benefits:
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with inferred types
- **Performance**: Optimized queries and better connection pooling
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive query builder and schema management
- **Migration Management**: Version-controlled database schema changes
- **Supabase Compatible**: Works seamlessly with Supabase's PostgreSQL

### Database Schema

The game uses two main tables:

1. **`scores`**: Stores player scores with ranking optimization
   - `player_id`: UUID for player identification
   - `game_id`: Links to specific game sessions
   - `score`: Final game score
   - `display_name`: Player's chosen display name
   - `run_ts`: Timestamp of the game run

2. **`game_actions`**: Server-authoritative game state management
   - Stores complete game states and action history
   - Enables anti-cheat validation and game replay
   - Supports concurrent game sessions per player

### Supabase Configuration

1. **Create a Supabase project** at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

2. **Get your database credentials**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Database
   - Copy the connection string from the "Connection Pooler" section
   - Use "Transaction" mode for better compatibility with Drizzle

3. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push  # For development
   # OR
   npm run db:migrate  # For production
   ```

4. **Configure Row Level Security (RLS)**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE scores ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE game_actions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   -- Allow public read access to scores
   CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access" ON scores
     FOR SELECT USING (true);

   -- Allow public insert access
   CREATE POLICY "Allow public insert access" ON scores
     FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

   -- Allow users to manage their own game sessions
   CREATE POLICY "Users manage own games" ON game_actions
     FOR ALL USING (true);
   ```

### Database Operations with Drizzle

```bash
# Generate migration files from schema changes
npm run db:generate

# Apply migrations to the database
npm run db:migrate

# Push schema changes directly (for development)
npm run db:push

# Open Drizzle Studio (database GUI)
npm run db:studio
```

### Database Configuration

The game requires a Supabase database connection for server-authoritative gameplay with full persistence, score tracking, and leaderboards.
